        <span>So hello again.<br>
        You already know my name, but you will learn my story of learning and becoming yourself right here and right now ⬇️.<br>
        I started learning programming in STEP software development courses in May 2021 🧐.<br>
        I studied in the courses until August 2022.<br>
        During this time, I managed to learn C ++ and OOP C ++, HTML, CSS, Java Script, SQL, Objective-C, Python and the basics of information technology 📖.<br>
        I also learned the Swift programming language.<br>
        At the end of August 2022, I entered Kharkiv Technological University "STEP" with a degree in Software Development 👨‍🎓.<br>
        Created a couple of applications for IOS 📱.<br>
